# BMI-Calculator
BMI Calculator i've done in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Still learning HTML,CSS and JavaScript, but this project helped me get some knowledge about them and their utility.

For those who intend to test it, copy the HTTPS link at the Code menu, and write at your terminal (i only tested this at the VSCode terminal) the code below:
```
git clone https://github.com/gabr1elluna/bmi-calculator.git
```
I'll keep practicing and adding more projects to my GitHub, please feel free to add some comment or open any issues, i'll love to learn what i could've done better.
For now, that's all, thank you for checking out this repository :)
